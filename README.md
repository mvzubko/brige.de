# Brige Service Management System

Development of a service management system for the company [Brige.de](https://brige.de) that includes a form for service technicians and the sales team.

The software will allow documenting work performed at client sites, capturing images, collecting additional information for future projects, and giving clients the ability to confirm successful work completion.

The system requirements are provided in the document [Service Requirements List (BRD) - English Version](/docs/brd.md)

The proposed system implementation is described in the document [Software Requirements Specification (SRS) - English Version](/docs/srs.md)
